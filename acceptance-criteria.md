## Validation Tests

### Manual Verification Tests
1. **Link Validation**: Click all [EVID] links to verify they point to correct code
2. **Feature Coverage**: Cross-reference README features against main.py functions
3. **Version Check**: Verify Python version matches Dockerfile
4. **Structure Match**: Compare documented structure against actual files

### Automated Checks (if applicable)
1. **Markdown Lint**: Ensure proper formatting
2. **Link Checker**: Validate all internal and external links
3. **Consistency Checker**: Verify terminology consistency
